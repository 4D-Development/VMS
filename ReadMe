Hello World!

This was a portion of our attempt at making a Volunteer Management System. I say a portion as we restarted after realizing that our 
orignal attempt was in NETCore 1.1, as opposed to the intended 2.1

Our group 4D Development consists of Andrew Hill, Dean Rice, David Munera, Daniel Orpreza. 

We encountered a number of issues in starting this development process, the first of which was getting familiar with git. 
You may notice that there are a number of seemingly pointless commits, branches, and reorganizations with this repo.
Those are the result of us teaching one another the command line interface for git.

Although we were quick to organize, I feel there was a lack of motivation for this project.
We failed to utilize the time available and the product reflects this.

As the semester has neared we've committed to buckling down over the coming days and months, and sincerely hope that our next
deliverable better reflects our interest in bettering not only ourselves but our community.

Thank you for reading,
Drew
